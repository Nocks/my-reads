# MyReads Project

This is my first react project of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. In this MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows me to select and categorise books in these categories:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read
* None

This project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

This is the link to the starter project files provided: [https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
